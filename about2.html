      <h2>Contraband Cinema</h2>
      <p>Is an Atlanta, Georgia based microcinema inspired by Craig Baldwin's <a href="http://othercinema.com/" target="_blank">Other Cinema</a> in San Francisco -- an ongoing series of experimental film, video and performance. Contraband Cinema strives to select and exhibit engaging and marginalized work through close collaboration with regional filmmakers, curators and established film institutions. By serving as an asdfasdfasdf for underground cinema it hopes to connect the Atlanta community with a larger network of like-minded filmmakers, festivals, and microcinemas.</p>
      <p>Contraband Cinema was founded by Marcus Rosentrater in 2011 and is continued through the creativity, inspiration, and support of the following individuals (listed alphabetically):</p>
