          Our <em>After School Special</em> took us back to the days where 16mm film was an instructional tool in American classrooms.
          Then for <em>Atlanta Film Festival Experimental Shorts</em> we teamed up with Atlanta Film Festival to celebrate experimental film.
          For <em>Living Cinema</em> we brought underground film legend Craig Baldwin to Atlanta for 3 shows with help from Film Love and GSU's Peripheral Visions.

        <h2><span>Season 1: Fall 2011</span></h2>
        <p>Season one of Contraband Cinema brought rare, new, and local films to over 100 Atlantans with 3 events at 3 different venues. 
          <em>Memory Ciphered in Celluloid</em> hosted the Georgia premiere of Helen Hills <em>The Florestine Collection</em>, Bill Morrison's <em>The Film Of Her</em>, and a collection of 16mm educational films presented by RUDERMEDIA (Ben Ruder) at Atlanta's oldest single screen independent theater, the Plaza Theatre.
          <em>Experiments in Terror</em> was a collaboration with our local horror film festival Buried Alive Film Festival. Director of the festival Blake Meyers co-curated a line-up spearheaded by Kenneth Anger's <em>Invocation Of My Demon Brother</em> on 16mm. The event took place at the spooked abandened schoolhouse known as the Arts Exchange.
          <em>Avant To Live</em> brought the focus on local camera-less works by mostly local filmmakers, Robbie Land, Christopher Childs, Michael Betancourt, Anna Spence, and the southern premiere o Sylvia Schedelbauer's <em>Sounding Glass</em>. This standing room only event was a touchstone for the intimate, engaged, local, community oriented screenings Contraband Cinema strives for heading into Season 2.
        <p>This inaugural season of Contraband Cinema could not have been possible without the assistance of Andy Ditzler, Craig Baldwin, Gideon C. Kennedy, Charles Judson, Gabe Wardell, Paula Martinez, Bradley Elfman (name), John Robinson, Ben Ruder, Mark Basehore, and <a href="http://www.behance.net/marybethbyram" target="_blank">Mary Beth Byram</a>.</p>
