        <h3>Helen Hill + Bill Morrison + Ruder Media + Other Cinema</h3> 
        <p class="location">Thursday October 6th @ 8pm at the Plaza Theatre</p> 
        <p>Film has always been an adversary of time. Whether it functions to recall, preserve, or condition, each of these films employs memory as the operational motive. Helen Hill's <em>The Florestine Collection</em> is husband Paul Gailinus' recollection of her through the restoration and completion of her final film; Bill Morrison's <em>The Film of Her</em> witnesses a dissident desire to preserve film's earliest memories; and RUDERMEDIA's <em>Film Education</em>, a cluster of 16mm educational films, demonstrates an attempt to alter collective cognizance. This exhibition of memory soaked cinema will screen at the Plaza Theatre, currently enduring its own campaign against the march of time.</p>
        <p>$6 admission. Come early to memorialize the occasion with 5 free seconds in the Super-8 Filmbooth.</p>
