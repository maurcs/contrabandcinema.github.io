         <p>Punks of the video world, glitch artists, use a wide array of new and old technologies to rebel against the hyper-slick and glossy world of contemporary media. Using their VCR's binary code, circuit boards, gaming consoles and video mixers, they strive to find the soul of the machine while showing viewers that broken is beautiful!</p>
        <p>Contraband Cinema will be presenting works by Tachyons +, Great Nordic Sword Fights, Big Pauper and local artists Michael Betancourt, Adam Bruneau, Anna Spence and Chris Chambers will be in attendance!</p>

Since Juan Ponce de Leon stepped into its marsh in 1513 Florida has been a concept up for grabs. The documentary films in this program tell stories of people who by choice, force or coercion have made a claim to the idea and place the Spanish called La Florida.</p>
           <p> Award winning films by Georg Koszulinski (in person), Lisa Danker and Carl Knickerbocker begin at 8pm. Q&amp;A following the films. <br>Come early for Robbins Barstow Florida vacation home movies (1973).</p>
