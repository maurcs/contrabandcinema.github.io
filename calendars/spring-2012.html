        <p>FREE! At the <a href="http://www.afpls.org/ponce-branch6" target="_blank">Ponce De Leon Library branch</a> on Friday March 16th @ 7:30pm</p>
        <p>Scholars Devin Orgeron, Marsha Orgeron and Dan Streible have published the first ever collection of essays to address the phenomenon of the American educational film. Contraband Cinema will celebrate the launch of their book <em><a href="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/FilmMediaPerformingArts/FilmStudies/?view=usa&amp;view=usa&amp;ci=9780195383843" target="_blank">Learning With The Lights Off</a></em> by bringing to the Ponce De Leon Library branch a presentation of 16mm educational films by filmmaker Bret Wood and collector Ben Ruder. These mid-century shorts are both artful and banal, timely and dated, stimulating and campy. PLUS a new beautifully crafted short film by Christopher Childs and Krista Strobel called <em>Re-Presenting Prelinger</em> that delicately weaves Rick Prelinger's concept of archives as cultural producers with footage from his massive collection of celluloid ephemera. Copies of the book will be on hand for your eager fingers to flip through. Christopher Childs, Bret Wood and Ben Ruder IN PERSON!</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Manic and irrepressible, an exuberant crank and a tireless activist, San Francisco film artist Craig Baldwin uses a seemingly inexhaustible trove of cheesy found footage and his own haphazardly shot dramatizations to rewire American history, reconfigure old conspiracy theories, and rail against the machine.&rdquo; - J Hoberman, <em>Village Voice</em></p>
        <p>On April 12th 2012 three film communities join forces to bring west coast underground film legend Craig Baldwin to Atlanta. One of <em>Senses Of Cinema's</em> &ldquo;great directors&rdquo;, Craig Baldwin is a recombinatory filmmaker who exists at the edge of contemporary cinema both through his films and his weekly film series, Other Cinema. The spread of his films in the last two decades, particularly <em>Tribulation 99</em>, <em>Sonic Outlaws</em> and <em>Spectres of the Spectrum</em>, introduced archival retrieval and culture jam to a wider audience of cineastes who embrace, implement and teach these practices. In 2003 Baldwin created the Other Cinema Digital label which highlights and distributes films from his 25+ years of microcinema programming. Under Baldwin's leadership Other Cinema remains the long-standing bastion of alternative film, video and performance in San Francisco's Mission District. Atlanta's own film series Film Love, GSU's Peripheral Visions, and Contraband Cinema fuse to recreate the Other Cinema experience at Atlanta's 489 Edgewood space where Craig Baldwin will host a screening and performance of living cinema. Entry is $7. <strong>Thursday, April 12th 8pm at 489 Edgewood.</strong></p>

        <p>The Films of Kelly Sears and Ruth Dusseault</p>
        <p>$6. At <strong>489 Edgewood</strong> Saturday April 21th 8pm</p>
        <p>On April 21st join Contraband Cinema to witness apocalyptic landscapes imagined and constructed, abandoned and found through the films of Kelly Sears and Ruth Dusseault. <em>Once It Started It Could Not End</em> by Sears finds the imprint of a high school disaster through the pages of abandoned yearbooks. Similarly, her <em>Cover Me Alpha</em> takes instructional quotes from military yearbooks to re-caption the activities of toy soldiers in battle. On the military line we switch to Dusseault's <em>D-Day Joplin</em> which traverses two landscapes, one constructed by humans for a paintball D-Day reenactment, the other just miles away in tornado devastated Joplin, Missouri. Then we'll turn a page to Sears' <em>Imprinted</em> which combines scotch tape extractions of rapture text and newspaper headlines from the Joplin tornados. The evening will close with a screening of Dusseault's award-winning <em>21st &amp; 20th</em> followed by a discussion with the filmmaker.</p>
