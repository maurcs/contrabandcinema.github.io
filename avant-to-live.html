        <h2>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</h2>
        <p>En route to the show, Anna Spence was seized by the Protection Of Popular Cinematic Output Retailing and Normalcy (P.O.P.C.O.R.N.). There was a struggle. Fortunately she was able to escape the blockade with her life, but not her film. A committed operative, Anna has bravely made her film available to us online. Please watch it here or on <a href="http://www.anna-spence.com/Site/Video/Entries/2011/7/28_Entry_1.html" target="_blank">her website.</a></p>
