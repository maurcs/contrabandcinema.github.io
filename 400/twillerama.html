         <p>Trespassing on a city dump, Animated duo Jeff Twiller and Randy J. Johnson host and curate a selection of animated short films (and one live action film) culminating in the first ever TWILLERAMA.  Jeff Twiller has an online presence known for his insightful film reviews and failed attempts at Parkour.  His knowledge of the history of animation is seen below in this special event he hosted at the Ottawa International Animation Festival:</p>

         <p>Twillerama features some of the best independent animation from filmmakers like Bill Plympton (Oscar Nominated Guard Dog), Leah Shore (ATLFF 13's OLD MAN), and Atlanta's home grown Brett W. Thompson!  The animation covers adult themes.  No children recommended.</p>

        <p>Along with Jeff and Randy, there is a special appearance by Todd Hanson (known best for his work with The Onion and the voice of Dan Halen on Adult Swim's Squidbillies)</p>

        <p>In between each film, Jeff and Randy provide commentary on the films and awards will be presented! </p>

        <p>TWILLERAMA premiered in Brooklyn, NY last month and was featured on the animation blog <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/next-wednesday-in-brooklyn-twillerama-animation-screening-98765.html" targer="_blank">Cartoon Brew</a>.</p>
