          <p>Contraband Cinema invites artists to create work inspired by <em>The Visitor</em>, a supernatural sci-fi thriller based in and filmed on location in Atlanta, Georgia in 1979. Art will be on display Friday, July 11th at Eyedrum. On Saturday July, 12th there will be a special screening of <em>The Visitor</em> in the same space with special guests in attendance.</p>

          <p>We are inviting all Atlanta artists to participate in this one-of-a-kind art exhibition that will feature new and original pieces based on or inspired by the film. <em>The Visitor</em> is overflowing with memorable scenes and surreal images that completely lend itself to be captured in any medium. The possibilities are endless!</p>

          <p>For those who have not seen the film, <em>The Visitor</em> is available to rent on DVD and Blu-Ray at Atlanta’s <a href="http://www.videodromeatl.com/">Videodrome</a> video store, or you can stream it through iTunes or Amazon Instant. Trust us. It’s well worth the rental fee.
