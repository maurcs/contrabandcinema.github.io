         <p>It all starts with a few words:</p>
 
          <p>"Her name is Katy Collins. She'll be eight years old..."</p>

          <p>Let the chase begin.</p>
 
          <p>Welcome to the weird world of <em>The Visitor</em>, a bizarre genre mash-up from 1979 that has continued to leave audiences scratching their heads for over 30 years. Drafthouse Films have blindsided cinema fans by re-releasing a lovingly restored and uncut version of this obscure and fascinating 70s gem! Contraband Cinema is proud to present a special screening of this looney masterpiece on July 12th at Eyedrum.</p>
 
          <p>Attempting to describe the plot of the film is a delightful challenge.</p>
 
          <p>Is it a science fiction version of <em>The Bad Seed</em>?</p>
 
          <p><em>The Omen</em> meets <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>?</p>
 
          <p>You be the judge!</p>
 
          <p>Starring a wide-range of cult movie personalities that range from Lance Henrikson (<em>Aliens</em>, <em>Pumpkinhead</em>), Franco Nero (<em>Django</em>, <em>Enter the Ninja</em>) and Joanne Nail (<em>Switchblade Sisters</em>, <em>The Gumball Rally</em>) to classic movie legends Glenn Ford (<em>The Big Heat</em>, <em>Gilda</em>), director John Huston (<em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, <em>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em>), Shelley Winters (<em>The Night of the Hunter</em>, <em>The Poseidon Adventure</em>)... and Sam Peckinpah (director of <em>The Wild Bunch</em> and <em>Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</em>)?!</p>
 
          <p>Based in and filmed on location in Atlanta, this unique screening is adding a new and exciting element: We are inviting all Atlanta artists to participate in a one-of-a-kind art exhibition that will feature new and original pieces based on or inspired by the film. <em>The Visitor</em> is overflowing with memorable scenes and surreal images that completely lend itself to be captured in any medium. The possibilities are endless!</p>
