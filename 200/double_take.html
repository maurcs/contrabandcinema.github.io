        <p>"If you meet your double, you should kill him." Coinciding with the Plaza Theatre's Hitchcock month, Contraband Cinema presents a feature length cinematic speculative tale of odd couples and double deals involving the life of Alfred Hitchcock, his double, the cold war, space race, sexual politics, and television's attack on cinema. Filmmaker Johan Grimonprez weaves clips from Hitchcok's film and television productions, 60's era television commercials and re-enactment to produce this smart, hilarious, and award winning documentary. (2009, 80min, B&W/Color)<br>
