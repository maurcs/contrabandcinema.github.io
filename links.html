        <dd>Other Cinema is a long-standing bastion of experimental film, video, and performance in San Francisco's Mission District. We are inspired and sustained by the ongoing practice of fine-art filmmaking, as well as engaged essay and documentary forms. But OC also embraces marginalized genres like "orphan" industrial films, home movies, ethnography, and exploitation, as media-archeological core-samples, and blows against consensus reality and the sterility of museum culture.</dd>
