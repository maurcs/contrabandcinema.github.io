         <p>April is Earth Month!<br><br>To celebrate, we invite filmmakers to share work pondering the invasion, destruction, creation and chaos occurring every day on our home rock. Films presented on video and 16mm will explore invasive plant and animal species, animate the corpses and excrement of various life forms, directly apply elements of nature on film stock, make the room glow with bio-luminescence, and showcase the total cycle of life on earth. Films by Stan Brakhage, Greta Snider, Josh Gibson, David Montgomery, Caleb Wood, and Atlanta's own Robbie Land (in person).<br><br>Come early for free seeds!<br><br>Doors at 7pm. Films promptly 8pm.<br><br>Downtown at Eyedrum, 88 Forsyth St SW, Atlanta, GA, 30303.</p>

              <strong>Nile Perch</strong> (2013) - Josh Gibson - 35mm (presented on video), b&amp;w, 17m
            </dt>

              <p>
                This film tracks a fish from a fisherman’s line on Lake Victoria in Uganda to export commodity. This hand-made 35mm film is a modern-day parable of the effects of globalization on Africa and a meditation on the economic and ecological impact of an invasive species.

              <strong>Quarry Movie</strong> (1999) - Greta Snider - 16mm, color, 10m
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The idea in the QUARRY MOVIE was not to use techniques to achieve a 'look,' but rather to achieve a presence, and then see what it looks like. Ten filmmakers fanned out over the landscape, documenting the place on 16mm, with and without the camera.

              <p>
                In an ongoing process, Robbie Land extends his 16mm film to record instances of bioluminescence occuring on Earth through direct application, light exposure and time-lapse.

            <dd>
              <p>
                The re-animation of a swarm of Green darner dragonflies that passed through Northeast Florida in late September. Simultaneously life at its most vibrant and carnage at its worst.

            <dd>
              <p>
                Through images of kudzu-covered forms, in hand-processed 35mm CinemaScope, radiating with the luminance of early cinema, this ode to the climbing, trailing, and coiling species evokes agricultural history and mythic textures of the South.
