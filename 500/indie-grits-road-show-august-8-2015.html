         <p>In Columbia, South Carolina a great stronghold for Southern filmmakers has formed. Since 2007 the <strong>Indie Grits Film Festival</strong> has charged blindly and passionately onto the scene, gathering some of the region's most innovative and creative cinematic, culinary, artistic and musical talents. What started as a DIY festival for a dedicated filmmaker audience has blossomed into a staple of the city’s progressive life providing thousands of visitors and locals access to an unmatched cultural experience. Contraband Cinema is honored to welcome the <em>Indie Grits Roadshow </em>to Atlanta where audiences in our city can experience the festival in short-form, for one night only. Join us and several Atlanta filmmakers for films, music and beverages Saturday, August 8th at Eyedrum.</p>
