         <p>The South is a strange place, isn't it?</p>

         <p>Our first screening of the summer kicks off with a block of short films that examine all manner of southern oddities, both silly and sinister. Presented digitally and on 16mm, these animated, live action and experimental films explore the atmosphere and character of the American South. You'll laugh, you'll be confused and you'll be very disturbed, all things you've probably experienced at a Waffle House at 2am. Award winning films by Einar Baldvin, Skizz Cyzyk, Ryan Gillis, Jason LaRay Keener, Simon Mercer, Kelly Sears and local filmmakers Blake Myers and Anna Spence (both in attendance).</p>

          <p>Cheerwine and Cornbread will be had as well as DVD giveaways.</p>
